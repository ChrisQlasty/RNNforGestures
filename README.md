### Description
The hand gesture recognition with sensors of low complexity and of low power demands is of interest especially in the context of mobile devices. The RNNrandHyp.py script available in this repo is dedicated to optimize the hyperparameters of a Recurrent Neural Network in order to recognize a set of 27 gestures with the highest possible accuracy. The input data comes from the optical linear sensor described in [1-2].

Some of the analysis of the results are presented in the [notebook.](RNN_analyzer.ipynb)
The more detailed description of the utilized sensor, results and discussion are presented in our the article from the IEEE Sensors Journal [Gesture Recognition with the Linear Optical Sensor and Recurrent Neural Network.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8357549/)

### Usage
The RNNrandHyp.py python script needs following packages to be installed:
```
sklearn, tensorflow, numpy, pandas, enum, datetime, sys
```

In order to run the script from console type:
```
python RNNrandHyp.py my_option my_gpu_memo my_hml
```
where with *my_option* equal to:
 * 0 - a single run on **raw** dataset, with predefined values of hyperparameters is evaluated,
 * 1 - **raw** dataset is selected, hyperparameters are sampled,
 * 2 - **features** dataset is selected, hyperparameters are sampled,
 * 3 - **HLfeatures** dataset is selected, hyperparameters are sampled, <br />
 
with *my_gpu_memo* in the range of 0 to 100:
 * a given percentage of GPU card memory is allocated for the script. In practice, less than 4GB is enough in this case. Therefore, if one has a 4GB card the *my_gpu_memo* could be set to 80 or 100, whereas for 16GB 20 or 25, <br />
 
with *my_hml*:  
 * a number telling the script how many loops with random search trials should be executed. If you wish to execute 100 trials and have 16GB card, you can run 4 scripts per 25 trials and *my_gpu_memo*=25.


##### Example:
In order to evaluate 16 trials on **raw** dataset, with randomly sampled hyperparameters on 0th GPU card, allocating 25% of its memory run:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python RNNrandHyp.py 1 25 16
```
